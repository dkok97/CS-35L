Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

I first perform the following commands 
to obtain all the files is Coreutils 7.6:

$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I then cd into the directory Coreutils 7.6. 
I find a file called INSTALL and I read the file using:

$ cat INSTALL

I find the command in INSTALL to configure it 
and run the following command:

$ ./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/dinkar/coreutils

I now navigate to the directory where
I installed this version of Coreutils

I then ran the following command to set the locale:

$ export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

I run which ls to find where the program is located. 
It is in the bin folder. 
I cd into the bin folder and run the buggy program:

./ls -l

A few of the outputs are:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad 107235 2017-10-24 04:54 [
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad  97899 2017-10-24 04:54 base64
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad  75911 2017-10-24 04:54 basename

This is buggy because the date format is YYYY-MM-DD

To apply the patch:

1. I cd into the coreutils-7.6 directory.
2. I create and edit a new file called patch-diff using vim.
3. I change a/NEWS, b/NEWS, a/src/ls.c, b/src/ls.c 
   with .a/NEWS, b/NEWS, a/src/ls.c, b/src/ls.c
4. I run the command:
   $ patch -p0 < patch.diff
5. Re-install the program using:
$ make
I notice that there are fewer lines in the output for make.
This is because we only need to re-install the ls part of the program.
The make program finds the relevant directories where the patch made a change.
It only re-makes these programs.
Everything else is ignored.

I can now compare this fixed version of ls to the broken version in:
/u/ma/ugrad/dinkar/coreutils (make installed the program here initially)

I run the command with the fixed ls:

$ ./src/ls -l /u/ma/ugrad/dinkar/coreutils/bin 

I run it for this directory because it’s the same one we ran the broken ls for.

The output is:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad 107235 Oct 24 04:54 [
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad  97899 Oct 24 04:54 base64
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dinkar maugrad  75911 Oct 24 04:54 basename

The time formate is now Month Day Time.
Therefore, it is fixed and I get the correct data format.

We run both versions of ls after patching and, 
notice that the old ls still does not work properly because,
it wasn’t overwritten by re-installation.

I now run the fixed ls on a directory that has files more than a year old.

$ ./src/ls -l /u/ma/ugrad/dinkar/

Some of the output is:

-rw-r--r-- 1 dinkar maugrad  4168 Oct 29  2016 main.cpp
drwx------ 2 dinkar maugrad  4096 Sep 27  2016 nsdefault
drwxr-xr-x 2 dinkar maugrad  4096 Jun  9 00:50 openmplab
drwxr-xr-x 2 dinkar maugrad  4096 Mar  7  2017 p0


We see two different types of output.
One type is for recent files, and one is for files more than a year old.

For recent files, the format is Month Day Time.
For files in more than a year old, the format is Month Day Year.
