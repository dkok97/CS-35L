Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change

2. We create a new branch using:

$ git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. We add our patch created in the lab part using:

$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. I read the documentation for:
 add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a).

5. We open emacs and type C-x 4 a to access
the the ChangeLog. We only create and individual
changeLog and not one for each file. 
We follow the changeLog format by reading the documentation.

6. We commit the changes made to the files using:

$ git add .
$ git commit -aF changeLog

7. We create a patch using:

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

This creates a file with all out changes
and we can share this with our partner.

8. I partnered up with Anurang from my lab to verify
if out patches work for each other.

He sent me his patch, and I sent him mine.
To verify it, I create a new temporary branch called temp.

$ git checkout v3.0 -b temp

I moved his patch to my directory and called it 
formatted-patch_anu.txt

To apply the patch, I used:

$ git am < formatted-patch_anu.txt

I ran git log to check if the patch was applied.
I saw the output as:

commit cdd866890a599d33eb0b7c95a4cc490f995f2d0d
Author: Anurang Bhuta <anurang@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
Date:   Tue Dec 5 19:32:12 2017 -0800

    2017-12-05 Anurang Bhuta <anurang@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu>
    
        maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
        * cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, sdiff.c, util.c:
        changed ` to ' for only code.


I then build the program using:

$ ./bootsrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

To check if the patch was successful, I ran :

$ ./src/diff . -

Output:

./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

Therefore, since it shows ' instead of `,
my partner’s patch was applied successfully.

9. To verify if the ChangeLog entry works, I ran:

$ make distdir

This creates a new folder diffutils-3.0.1-cdd8 
I cd into the folder and inspect the ChangeLog file

$ emacs ChangeLog

The first entry in the ChangeLog is the log entry
is my partner’s log entry shown above. Therefore,
the patch was successful.

10. I exit the server I am in and log in again
using:

$ ssh -X dinkar@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu

I go to the right directory using:

$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

I then run gitk in this directory but it failed.
This is because the path was not correct.
So I change it to:

$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

And I run gitk again.

This opens up a gui that shows us all the commits.
I scroll down to the the commit not newer than
25th Jan 2015 and take a screenshot.
A description of the screenshot is in:
gitk-description.txt
