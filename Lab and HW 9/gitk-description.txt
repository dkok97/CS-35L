Homework: gitk screenshot description

We have the following parts to the screenshot.

1. Upper left:

This window shows us a tree like structure.
It is a hierarchical tree of all the commits
and their commit messages and their relationships 
with the branches of the repository. We also see 
the position of the HEAD pointer.

2. Upper right:

The left part has the list of the authors of all
the commits along with their email. The right part
has the list of dates of when the commits were made.

3. Bottom left:

This has the changeLog of the commit.
The changeLog contains the Author, committer,
parent node, child node, branches and what it
follows and precedes. We also have the file changes
in the format that would be outputted by the diff
command.

4. Bottom right:

This window displays the files impacted by the commit.

In the middle of the screenshot, we also see the
SHA1 ID of the commit.
