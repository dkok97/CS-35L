Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1.

$ man -k keyword

After reading the man page of the command ‘man’ (using $ man man), I found out that we can use the -k tag to search for a keyword.

2.

$ which cp
/usr/bin/cp

$ which wc
/usr/bin/wc

I used the command which <command_name> which returns the full path of the command.
I found out about this command using:
$ man -l path command

3.

I search for these executables in the directory /usr/bin.

To get the required files, I use:
$ find -executable -iname ‘?’
.
./[
./w
./X

I read the man find page to learn about these commands

To find out what these executables do, we read their man page.

[ - the man page does not specify what this command does, so I ignored it.
w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
X - man X does not return anything. I ran ls -l and found out it is a link to Xord. man Xorg tells us that it is is a network-transparent graphical window system.

4.

I found the command readlink using man -k symbolic links that prints symbolic links.
So the command I ran is:
$ readlink /usr/bin/emacs
/etc/alternatives/emacs

So /etc/alternatives/emacs is the file that is executed.

5.

I looked at the man page of chmod to find out about what the following are.

g+s: This command sets the group ID (setgid) of the current directory. So this command gives the user permissions of the group owner of the files.
o+x: This command removes the permission to execute from the files in that directory for other users.

6.

I searched the man page of find and found the command mtime.
The command I used is:
$ find -mtime 21
Which searches for files modified 21*24 hours ago, which is 3 weeks.

7.

I used the command:
$ find -mtime 21 -type d

This returned no files because I’m in a directory where I don’t have permission or no directory has been modified.

8.

I first locate where find is located using:
$ which find
/usr/bin/find

So I go to the /usr/bin directory.

Once I am in the directory, I ran the command:
$ find -type l

This lists all the symbolic links (found in the man page of find)

The output is:

./xzegrep
./htxelatex
./mysql_config
./gpgv
./lpstat
./pnmcomp
./mac2unix
./texconfig-dialog
./latex
./gnatgcc
./dvired
./jstack
./pnmenlarge
./wsgen
./apropos
./mk4ht
./pstack
./rmid
./sgml2xml
. . . . . 

I will not list all of them. It prints out 293 symbolic links.
We can find the number using the command:
$ ls -l | grep ^l | wc
This counts the number of lines of the output (used man grep to learn about it)

9.

I list all the files using ls with the flags -t that sorts it using modification time and the flag -l to output a long list so I can tell which is a regular file (the ones that start with ‘-‘)
I learnt about this using man ls.
The command is:

$ ls -t -l

This outputs all the files with time. The last one is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0, which is the oldest file.

10.

I run the command man locale for information about the command.
It says /usr/share/i18n/locales is the usual path for locale definition files, so that might be the directory for its data files.
Also, after some research, I found out that the environment variables that the command is based on are defined in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale.
Also, there are locale files in a subdirectory of usr that I found using find -name locale that might contain the data.

11.

To search for commands with a keyword, I used C-h a. This allowed me to type a keyword into the mini-buffer. I typed ‘sort’ and the output was the following commands:
Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

12.

C-M-a (beginning-of-defun): Moves the cursor to the beginning of the function the pointer is in.

C-M-b (backward-sexp): Moved the cursor by one word, i.e., movement in a balanced expression.

C-M-c (exit-recursive-edit): Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.

C-M-d (down-list): Move forward down into the nearest group of balanced parentheses.

C-M-e (end-of-defun): Moves the cursor to the end of the function the pointer is in.

C-M-f (forward-sexp): Moved the cursor by one word, i.e., movement in a balanced expression.

C-M-g: does nothing

C-M-h (mark-defun): Put region around whole current or following defun

13.

I used C-h k C-g to find out what the command does. It said, 

C-g: C-g runs the command keyboard-quit, which is an interactive compiled

Basically, it aborts the current command that is running. During the execution of a Lisp code, for example like search, sort or list, this character aborts the process abruptly.

14.

I ran the command C-h-b “yank” and found out that yank pastes the last stretch of killed text.

15.

The difference is that the dired command in emacs also lists the current and parent directory (. and ..) and ls -l does not.
Also, dired lists the available memory in the first line and ls -l does not.
